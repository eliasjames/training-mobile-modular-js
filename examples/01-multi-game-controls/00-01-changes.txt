Goal: Create & play multiple TicTacToe games simultaneously
Reason: Common request, demonstrates modularity
Method: Refactor methods from specific to general
Notes: After this step, the button click will create multiple game boards. 
However, they will not fully work until the 03 step.
The boards will appear separate, but will share memory.
