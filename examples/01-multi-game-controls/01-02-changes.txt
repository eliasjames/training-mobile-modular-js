Goal: Create & play multiple TicTacToe games simultaneously
Reason: Common request, demonstrates modularity
Method: Move all functionality underneath global object
Notes: This is another intermediate step on the way to multiple games. 
Games will not fully work until the 03 step.
The boards will appear separate, but will share memory.

- add script tag for 02-init.js
02-bind.js
- Move initGame function to 02-init.js
- Make all functions into methods on an object
- Make that object the return value of a function
- Assign that function to 'bind' property on global ticTacToe object
02-tictactoe.js
- Make all functions into methods on an object
- Make that object the return value of a function
- Assign that function to 'game' property on global ticTacToe object
02-init.js
- Create global ticTacToe object
- Create 'binds' and 'games' properties & assign blank objects as placeholders
- Move initGame function from 02-bind.js to an object property
-- Change name to newGame
-- Create a game ID dynamically based on Date
-- Call game and bind functions 
-- Store result in placeholder objects using game ID as property name
